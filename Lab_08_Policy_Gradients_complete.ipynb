    "# Policy gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients is a family of algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems by directly optimizing the policy in policy space. This is in stark contrast to value based approaches (such as Q-learning used previous practices or in [Learning Atari games by DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning). This practice implements the Vanilla Policy Gradient (also known as REINFORCE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients have several appealing properties, for one they produce stochastic policies (by learning a probability distribution over actions given observations) whereas value based approaches are deterministic as they will typically choose actions greedily with respect to the value function being learned which can lead to under-exploration (one needs to introduce exploration strategies such as $\\epsilon$-greedy explicitly to get around this). Another advantage of policy gradients is their ability to tackle continuous action spaces without discretisation which is necessary for value based methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest disadvantages of policy gradients is their high variance estimates of the gradient updates. This leads to very noisy gradient estimates and can de-stabilize the learning process. Significant efforts in reinforcement learning research with policy gradients in the past few years has been about trying to reduce the variance of these gradient updates to improve the trainability of these algorithms."

    "In logistic regression we use the parametrized logistic function $f_\\theta(x)=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ where $\\theta, x$ are the $k$-dimensional weight and feature vectors respectively (we assume the bias term is incorporated within $\\theta$ and $x$). Because there are only two classes, we interpret the value of $f_\\theta(x)$ as $p(y=1\\vert \\theta,x)$, i.e. the probability of the first class. Then we get the probability of the second class for free since probabilities must sum to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametrized softmax function defined as $\\sigma_\\theta(x)_i=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta_i\\cdot x}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}e^{\\theta_j\\cdot x}}$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$ is a generalization of the logistic function to $m$ output classes and extends logistic regression to multi-class problems. We interpret the value of $\\sigma_\\theta(x)_i$ as $p(y=i\\vert \\theta_i, x)$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$. Note that with softmax there is a separate weight vector $\\theta_i$ for each of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a subtle difference in going from the logistic function to the softmax function that is rarely explained but becomes apparent when you compare using the softmax function instead of the logistic function for a two-class problem. Essentially, the logistic function only maintains a parameter vector $\\theta$ of length $k$ for estimating the first class probability while the softmax function maintains a separate parameter vector for each of the classes, thus in the two-class case a softmax formulation would have $2k$ parameters - twice as many as in logistic regression. This means that the softmax formulation results in redundant parameters - this is called overparametrization.\n",

    "In particular, we can pick $\\phi=\\theta_0$ thus setting the first parameter vector to be identically zero in effect eliminating $k$ redundant parameters from calculations. Doing so in the $2$-class problem we would recover ordinary logistic regression with $k$ parameters, i.e. setting $\\theta_0\\to 0$ and $\\theta_1\\to\\theta_1-\\theta_0=:\\theta$ would give $p_0=\\dfrac{1}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ and $p_1=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ as in vanilla logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our cartpole example because we used a vanilla logistic policy we ended up with four trainable weights, one for each of the observations. However, had we gone for a softmax policy with two classes we would have eight trainable weights instead.\n",

    "In an $m$-class problem, the number of weights maintained by softmax is $m\\times k$ but $k$ of these can be eliminated as shown. In practice, however, it is less hassle to keep the softmax formulation as is since enforcing some parameters to be zero would lead to less clean code and extra difficulties when calculating gradients.\n",
