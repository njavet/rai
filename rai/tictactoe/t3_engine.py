Game engine for Tic-Tac-Toe

Description of the game state:
------------------------------
    
The fields in the board are addressed with single numbers in the following way:

   0|1|2
   -----
   3|4|5
   -----
   6|7|8

A board is encoded as a string of single characters of length 9, for example:
    
   '   XO    '
    012345678 (<- field numbers)

where empty fields are marked by ' ', Xs are marked by 'X' and Os by 'O'. In
the example, there's X on field 4 and an O on field 5 (the middle position).

The complete game state equals the current board configuration because the 
question who's turn it is can be deduced from the number of empty fields: it is 
X's turn iif the number of free fields is 9/7/5/3/1 -> uneven; otherwise it is 
O's turn.
