# CSP vs pure backtracking
29.12.23
I don't understand the difference between using
csp for sudoku aka factored states and then backtracking
vs just use backtracking with atomic states

-> 06.01.24 csp uses contraint propagation, backtracking with
	atomic states doesn't

why do we need to include probabilities -> maximum likelyhood
loss functions

# loss functions
I don't understand that the ml model needs to predict the distribution
parameters 

SGD:
	the gradient needs to be computed for the loss function.
	the loss function is the MSE / cross entropy loss. so it's
	linear and easy to compute. 
	the model that approximates a complex non linear function 
	doesn't matter, since the gradient will not be computed
	for the complex function


what was the thing with the perceptron and (xor -> not linearly 
separable). why didn't they connected many perceptron ? since
it comes from neuron, but they only used one neuron ?


a neural network is ALWAYS a linear combination of activation 
functions ?

* linear regression closed formula -> getting desperate

* why isn't the whole derivate of the loss function calculated ?
* its a linear combination of activation function ..

why values, queries and keys ?

best first search, visited nodes.. in the literature neighbor 
nodes are checked if in visited node, but the euler path 
finding problems only work without this.
